<div class="about">
  My name is Pedro Teixeira and I am 28 years old. <br />
  I was born and raised in Porto - Portugal, where I got my M.Sc. in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP - insert link).
  In this course I gained an interest in <b>Web and Mobile Development</b>, mostly through the various projects I was required to do. <br />
  I spent 13 years learning English in The British Council (insert link), where I got the CPE (Certificate of Proficiency in English) and received a "B" grade, amongst other certificates. <br />
  I also spent a year learning Japanese and received the level 10 Japan Kanji Aptitude Test certificate.
